    description="On September 8, the “Biggest Block Party of the Year” ushered in a night in which societies climaxed their competition for the attention and affection of the new freshman class. With the enticement of delicious food, rowdy games, and decorated tents, society members aided freshmen in their chose of a society. The following night, freshmen officially chose their society at Induction. Welcoming newcomers into society, current members introduced their freshman to the distinctive traditions of their new society. Since societies constitute an integral part of campus life, Rush and Induction activities marked the beginning of multiple opportunities to build friendships, develop leadership skills, and mature together in Christ."
