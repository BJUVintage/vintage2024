The Welcome Week theme—OWN IT—encouraged students to accept personal responsibility for their studies, personal relationships, and spiritual growth. The week sponsored “meet and greet” sessions for academic majors, orientation for new students, and special sessions for international students. Opening exercises and evangelistic meetings established the foundation for a successful year. "></basic-layout>

  <basic-layout big-photo-name="/events/chapel.jpg" title="Fall Chapel Theme"
    description="Throughout fall chapels Dr. Benson challenged the student body with the theme “Nehemiah: Life on Mission.” As he covered the book of Nehemiah, students learned how God greatly used a man who obeyed God no matter the overwhelming trials. With a focus on Nehemiah’s deep personal walk with God and his response to every obstacle with prayer and worship, Dr. Benson imparted practical advice for problem-solving as well as wisdom for living according to God’s plan no matter the situation. As students prepare to minister in a spiritually darkening world, this chapel theme inspired them to be shining lights for His glory. "

  <basic-layout big-photo-name="/events/harvest.jpg" title="Fall Festival" description="The fourth annual Harvest Festival features a “treat trail” across campus along with unique costumes of students, faculty, and staff.

This event, designed to deepen faculty-student relationships, provided an outlet for humor and ingenuity. 
    Fall Festival, which followed the annual Turkey Bowl, fostered school spirit and unity as students engaged in various activities. The faculty chili cook-off, with the winner determined after tasting samples, kicked off the event. While some students enjoyed popcorn, cupcakes, and apple cider, others raced through an inflatable obstacle course. Despite cold temperatures, the night offered students a welcomed pause from their students as well as a memorable climax to the 2023 Turkey Bowl evening.

  <basic-layout big-photo-name="/events/bibconf.jpg" title="Bible Conference"
    description="The 2024 Bible Conference theme, “Look on the Fields: Cultivating a Heart for the Harvest,” emphasized evangelism, the natural result of believers’ changing their perspective from temporal to eternal. This mindset requires loving God and then loving others. Dr. Benson opened the conference on Tuesday, February 13, and five additional speakers spoke from the Word of God to students, faculty, and visitors throughout the rest of the week. The speakers included Jim Tillotson, Matt Morrel, Brent Belford, Dave Doran, and Billy Gotcher. This year BJU partnered with Dare for More, a ministry seeking to create an arm of prevention and intervention for women affected by trafficking, abuse, and poverty in Guatemala. The University set a target of $150,000. Student-initiated fundraisers and generous donations provided funds for Dare for More to purchase two vehicles to transport women and children to safe houses as well as carry supplies to training centers. These centers instruct women in trade so that they can become self-supporting. By sitting under the preaching of God’s Word and by raising funds for a ministry dedicated to evangelism, those attending Bible Conference end the week refreshed in soul and spirit."

  <basic-layout big-photo-name="/events/vintage.jpg" title="90 Years of Vintage"
    description="This year, the Vintage celebrates its 90th publication. Since 1934, this annual yearbook has provided a record of University students and personnel, as well as key events that take place in the academic year. Though the production has changed since the organization’s inception, each book remains a timeless repository of memories. No longer do writer compose on paper or typewriters, and no longer do designers cut photographs and place them in the books by hand. However, each book is a special keepsake for members of the University family. Yearbooks, by preserving a chapter in the University’s history, allow students, faculty, and staff to recall cherished memories. Additionally, each book presents a spiritual theme to edify its readers and is dedicated to one or more faculty members, staff members, or administrators who have faithfully served the University. Flipping through a yearbook’s pages transports the reader back to a time of camaraderie as well as academic and spiritual growth. "
