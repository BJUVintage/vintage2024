    description="Welcome Week introduces incoming freshmen as well as
returning students to University life. The 2022-23 welcome
theme—OWN IT—challenged students to accept personal
responsibility for the academic year and their future. The
week sponsors unique activities, including “meet and
greet” for majors, student orientation, and international
student orientation to acclimate students to their programs,
faculty, and peers. From check-in to opening exercises,
Welcome Week equips students for a successful year."

    title="Society Rush"
    description="On September 9, freshmen poured onto the lower
athletic fields, met by enthusiastic society members—
some decked out in Western attire, others dotted
with face paint. The annual Society Rush Party had
commenced. At each “rush,” societies compete for
new members through food, games and cheers.
The next night, freshmen officially choose their
society at Induction. Implementing their unique
traditions, societies welcome new members, and
freshmen begin developing lasting friendships.
Societies constitute an integral part of campus life
through providing students with opportunities for
leadership, community and spiritual growth."

    title="Christmas Celebration"
    description="Bob Jones University celebrated its 33rd year of staging a
Christmas Lighting ceremony, enhanced this year with unique
seasonal festivities. The Christmas Village provided free family
activities such as cookie decorating, storytelling, games and
crafts. The University sponsored food trucks and s’mores
stations for those seeking tasty treats. The Alumni Christmas
Market highlighted a local collection of handcrafted jewelry,
baked goods and paintings. As part of the lighting ceremony,
the Bob Jones University Singers, directed by Dr. David Parker,
led the caroling. Across front campus, hundreds of flickering
candles signified the event’s popularity. Artificial snow drifted
from above the choir, as “Let it Snow” echoed through the
night. Following one short, suspenseful moment of silence, a
magical array of lights illuminated the campus. Orderly, white
bulbs outlined Rodeheaver Auditorium, while dangling purple
and blue lights christened surrounding trees and bushes."

    title="Faculty Forums"
    description="During the fall semester, Bob Jones University held four forums focusing on human
dignity. Faculty forums present biblically informed perspectives on an array of current
social issues. As subject matter experts, the university faculty offer unique insights
into the forum topics and are sometimes accompanied by guest topic specialists. The
speakers share their expertise on key issues and moderate the discussion, allowing
attendees to consider various viewpoints. After the main presentation, participants
field questions from members of the audience. The unstructured formatting of
these forums allows for biblically informed academic responses to relevant topics."

    description="Each year, Bob Jones University begins both fall and
spring semesters with evangelistic services. Required for
students and open to the public, these meetings emphasize
the centrality of the Gospel to the University’s mission.
During the fall semester, Dr. Pettit challenged students
to understand God’s grace in salvation and, in response
to that grace, to seek a biblical transformation of their
minds. Tim Chapman, alumnus and missionary to Peru,
preached the spring evangelistic services. His sermons
emphasized forgiveness through and satisfaction in Christ."

    title="Spring Chapel Theme"
    description="The spring chapel theme “Truth and Love”
focused on 1 John 4. Analyzing John’s
unique circular writing style and applying
the apostle’s doctrine, Dr. Pettit challenged
students to discover the core meaning of
mature Christianity. The theme emphasized
reliance on love to overcoming fear and
commitment to truth as the path to imitating
Christ. In contrast to a world that denies
truth and seeks to redefine love, this highly
relevant topic addressed the balance of
both virtues, each vital to spiritual maturity."

    title="Bible Conference"
    description="The 2023 Bible Conference centered on the theme
of Chesed, God’s steadfast love. From Tuesday
night through Friday night, students, faculty and
visitors attended services. The event provided the
University family an opportunity to refocus on God’s
character as well as a respite from academics.
This year, BJU donated the conference’s offering to Harvest
House, the sole foster ministry on the island of Guam.
Harvest House provides physical, social, mental, and
spiritual support to both foster children and their families.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of foster
children on the island doubled, creating the necessity of
expanding Harvest House with a second facility. To help
meet this need, the University set a target amount of
$150,000 to “Build Hope for Harvest” through numerous
student-initiated fundraisers and generous donations."
