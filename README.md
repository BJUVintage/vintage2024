# Greetings vintage peoples

This is just a reworking of Elias Witt's 2023 website.

1. install nvm
2. install node via nvm (trust me its better this way than the normal install)
3. clone the github vintage2023 repo (you can do this whenever really)
4. go to your repo folder and type in the terminal `npm install` and then `npm run dev` 
5. you can now go to `localhost:3000` on your browser and view the website
