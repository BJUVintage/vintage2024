    description="The Bruins volleyball team secured the NCCAA DII
National Championship, defeating Arlington Baptist
Universityz 3-1. This success marked the team’s fifth
straight season of winning the national title. Freshmen
Kiersten and Katherine Hoopes and senior Emma Riddle
earned 1st team All-Region honors. The Bruins women
rallied their playing spirit from the theme “Keep Looking
Up,” taken from Colossians 3. Although committed to
developing resilience and competitiveness, the team also
sought to focus on Christ. Reflecting on the real purpose
of the team, Coach Vickie Denny stated, “Win or lose, we
want to show Christ to those we come in contact with."
