    description="Academic teams in robotics, biology and computer programming develop innovative skills and provide valuable competition and career-focused activities outside the classroom. These programs provide students the unique opportunity to work with peers in their specific areas of interest. The team membersâ€™ collaboration on year-long projects prepares students to participate in state and nation-wide events. By stimulating teams intellectually and relationally, these challenges develop competency in academics and leadership. "
